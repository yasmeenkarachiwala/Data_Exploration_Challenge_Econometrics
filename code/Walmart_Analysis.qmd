## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

# Step 1 - Loading relevant libraries 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)
library(vtable)
library(fixest)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
```

# Step 2-Loading the files, EDA and Transformation

```{r}
# reading the data
# As outlined in instructions to avoid the error in reading moving one level up y using ../
# dmy(Date) to convert it to correct date format 
walmart <- read.csv("../raw_data/Walmart_Sales (1).csv") %>% mutate(Date = dmy(Date))
str(walmart)
```

```{r}

```

```{2 * 2}
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
